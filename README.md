## ðŸš€ Getting started

### Prerequisites

<!-- 
   Which software or libraries are needed to be able to install this project?
 -->

- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) (recommended) or Node Version
	Manager ([Mac](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) | [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows))
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- Access to the `the-cocktail-collective` Google project

### Installation

<!-- How to install this project (after having the prerequisites)? -->

1. [Setup application default credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc) in the
	 gcloud cli.
	 This is needed to authenticate for gcloud services like Cloud Storage.
2. Copy the contents of `.env.example` to a new file `.env.local` (root project folder) and modify accordingly.
3. Run these commands:

```shell
# Run the mongodb database locally with docker
docker compose up -d

# Make sure you are using the correct node version, Volta does this automatically
# When using nvm, locate the `volta.node` key in `package.json` and set the version accordingly
nvm use <version>

# Install npm dependencies
npm i
```

### Development

<!-- How to actually start developing? -->

```shell
# Run a dev-server for the api
npm run dev -w server

# In a separate terminal, run a dev-server for the client
npm run dev -w client
```

### Deployment / Release process

GitHub Actions are used for automatic code-checking.

- On merge for the main branch:
	- Run tests for the server
	- Run a build for the server

For infrastructure deployments see [Terraform](#Terraform)

## ðŸ¤š Good to know

<!-- 
  A place to provide extra information (or links to it) about the project.

### Terraform

We use Terraform for infrastructure as code. Authentication from Terraform to Google Cloud is done via ADC, see [setting up ADC](#installation).

### Workspaces

We use npm workspaces to manage the monorepo. To install packages, run it in the root and specify which workspace you
need it in like this:

```shell
npm i <package> -w server # To install <package> in the server workspace
npm run dev -w client # To run the dev command in the client workspace
```

### Dependabot

We use Dependabot for automatic dependency updates

- Creates a PRs for all outdated dependencies
- Checks for NPM & GitHub Actions dependencies
- Every monday at 6:00 (GMT+1)

### Secrets

The server has secrets (hashing keys, api keys etc.).
These are stored in different for the different environments:

- The development secrets are fetched from the `server/.env.local` file.
- The testing secrets are fetched from the `.env.test` file.
	- These are used in local tests & GitHub Actions
	- Because of this, they are checked into version control, make sure not to put actual credentials in this file!
- The production secrets are fetched from GCP Secret Manager
